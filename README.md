# AnimeSpotify

This repository lists every anime song (opening, ending, insert song) available legally on Spotify. 

Each list is a markdown file with the anime and its songs titles and artists.

If you see any missing song or you want to add previous season's song don't hesitate to open an issue (giving me the link)

Just open an issue and I will add it ASAP!
